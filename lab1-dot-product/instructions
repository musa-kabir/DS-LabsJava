Instructions:

Write a Java program that:

Creates two integer arrays a and b, each of length n.

Fills both arrays with randomly generated integer values (you may use java.util.Random or Math.random()).

Computes a third array c such that:

c[i]=a[i]×b[i],for i=0,1,…,n−1
Prints the original arrays a and b, followed by the resulting array c.

Test your program with n = 5.

Once your program runs successfully:

Save and upload your Java source file(s) to the lab1-dot-product directory on GitHub.
Take screenshots of the program running and showing the generated arrays and their dot product.
